# Regorover
A lunar rover or Moon rover is a space exploration vehicle designed to move across the surface of
the Moon. Effects of uneven terrain, extreme temperature differentials, dust issues and radiation
protecting. This is our lunar rover prototype. We have named it Regover, as it is meant to navigate
the lunar soil, known as regolith. It is made of PVC pipes, HC-05 Bluetooth Module, HC-SR04
Ultrasound Sensor, 6 Wheels, DC Motors and an Arduino Uno board to control its navigation. The
mass of the rover is 2.5 kilograms. It can attain a maximum speed of 0.5 km/h. The power source is
an 18650 lithium ion battery with a nominal voltage of 3.7 volts. The diameter of the wheel is 6 cm
and we ensured that we selected a tire with maximum friction to help the rover climb uneven
surfaces. The terrain of the lunar surface has been defined by meteor strikes. Continual impacts of
micrometeoroids have resulted in an extremely fine, loosely-compacted soil. Our rover has the
ability to navigate uneven surfaces. However, many of the large-scale features, such as steep crater
walls and large boulders, are insurmountable obstacles to the rover. In order to identify such
obstacles, we have included an ultrasound sensor that senses objects in a distance of 50 cm. If it
detects an object the buzzer goes off, preventing the movement of the rover so as to avoid physical
harm.
